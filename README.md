First Initialization

Attached is the form

We are developing individual functions for the form. The fields are given below

1) Name 
2) Age
3) Height
4) Gender

The functions are given below

public class Data{
  String Name;
  int age;
  float height;
  String gender;

1) public Data getData(){
    Data d;
    d.Name = Test1.getData();
    }
    
2) public void setData(Data d){
    Name.setData(d.Name);
    }
    
3) public void saveData(Data d){
    System.out.println(d.Name);
    }
    
4) public Data readData(){
    Data d;
    d.Name = "Kofi";
    }
}


We are not supposed to store in the file anymore (although doing it now won't be bad.... :D)
Meeting is on Wednesday

Let me know if anything!
